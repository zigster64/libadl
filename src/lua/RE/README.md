# Revolution & Empire

Encoding the Revolution & Empire rules into LUA functions.

Also known as the unofficial "Empire version 6", this set of rules from Todd Fischer are the 
ultimate evolution of the Empire series of rules.

.. at least until Empire 7 comes out anyway.

A massively complex set of rules that are tough to play, but highly realistic.

They cover mulit-corps battles with Division sized units as command Maneuver Elements,
but with Battalions and detached companies at the tactical end. (Same scale as Empire basically)

Best played as an all-weekend battle on a huge table with lots of figures and a handful of players.

Real Napoleonic Wargaming for die hard fans.

Featuring :
- detailed skirmish combat
- highly modified artillery rules
- campaign fatigue, battle fatigue, and artillery fatigue
- detailed rules on deployments
- commander actions
- highly detailed rules on leader injuries !
- a few Chef de Bataillon level tweaks thrown in for Battalion formations and evolutions. 

Probably a bit more complicated than straight Empire, these rules have a huge number 
of extra tables to consult, so they are a great candidate for automation.

## Getting a hardcopy

Like all the rules engines in this program, it is recommended that you purchase 
a set of the real rules for the full details.

This program does NOT attempt to encapsulate the entire rules text, but rather 
an abbreviated form, with a nice front end for automation and networked game play.

Getting a copy is a bit difficult - try caliver books in the UK, or Noble Knight Games in the USA.

They are hard to get hold of, not to mention expensive, so it will take some effort to get a copy.

It is VERY much worth it though - one of the best sets of rules out there !

## Modding

Modding of the rules is highly encouraged.

Feel free to clone the files in this directory, and tweak the rules, the die roll modifiers, 
and the combat tables to fine tune your own house rule variations to the max.
